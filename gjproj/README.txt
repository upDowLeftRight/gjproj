This is a game project that is being developed for the 2019 GMTK Game Jam https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2019

This is a collaborative project between 2 people creating a sidescroling adventure game with no turning back.

start an adventure in a barren land with strangely regular leafless trees with no end in sight. 
The first thing you must to is punch a tree (left click) and make a sword.(costs 20 wood for a wooden sword, press enter to craft)
if you have multiple recipes available - the list on the left - press 'z' to cycle between them.

stone sword - 20 stone + 1 wood sword

blocks may also be placed with right click and if you are holding a sword right click attacks in a small radius around you.

remember to hit the ghosts before they hit you and good luck.
